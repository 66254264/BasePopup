### Feature

 - This library acts as a base class and does not interfere with your implementation, don't worry about being restricted by Api when implementing certain methods.
 - No need to worry about how to calculate offset for position control, just simply set [**Gravity**](https://www.yuque.com/razerdp/basepopup/qnu3qd), you can control your popups as you wish.
 - Whether [**Animation**](https://www.yuque.com/razerdp/basepopup/mg3bcw#onCreateShowAnimation) or [**Animator**](https://www.yuque.com/razerdp/basepopup/mg3bcw#onCreateShowAnimator), just write the animation as you normally would. You can complete the dynamic design of Popup, do not need xml, do not care about other compatibility issues.
 - Separation of background from content, support for [**background blurring**](https://www.yuque.com/razerdp/basepopup/udccdq#12bedc89),[**background color Settings**](https://www.yuque.com/razerdp/basepopup/gscx3g#aiRz7),or even [**change the background to your View**](https://www.yuque.com/razerdp/basepopup/gscx3g#e96cp),all of which can be done with a simple setup, with the subject isolated from the background, without worrying about the key event's issues.
 - BasePopup can help you to solve the problem of touch events in Popup. Pass-through, click-through and disappear or not are all just a matter of configuration.
 - PopupWindow automatically anchors the AnchorView, slide to follow it off screen. AnchorView disappears without complex logic setup, just by [**linkTo**](https://www.yuque.com/razerdp/basepopup/api) method by telling BasePopup to do it for you.
 - Simple PopupWindow doesn't want to create a new class and wants to have chain calls? No problem, [**QuickPopupBuilder**](https://www.yuque.com/razerdp/basepopup/ob329t) was created for this purpose, and believe that You'll love it more and more.

### Precautions

  - **Please be sure to read this README carefully. Please check the changelog for each version upgrade, which can reduce unnecessary detours for you.**
  - **Support is no longer supported in version 2.2.2, it is recommended that you upgrade to AndroidX as soon as possible.**
  - **Please pay attention on the dependence version, the Release version is a stable version, and Snapshot is a preview version.**
    - Release version: Generally published to Release after repeated verification of the Snapshot version. If you have higher stability requirements, please use the Release version.
    - Snapshot version: new features, issue fixes will be published  to the Snapshot version, Snapshot version is updated more frequently, but usually has new features, if you like to test new features and stability requirements are not high, please use the Snapshot version.
    - **Switching between Release and Snapshot versions may cause Build to fail. At this time, you can clean Project.**

<br>
